#### This project is to create and test a Restaurant Management Program that archives the following criteria:
 1. Store `information` about the food served at the restaurant. 
 2. Provide the user with a `simple` and `easy` interface, which does not affect the `performance`, or `quality` of the service at the restaurant.
 3. A `foolproof` error prevention mechanism that does not allow the program to crash mid-operation.
 4. The use of a Database Management System to keep `logs` and track the data `essential` to the restaurant.
 5. A `secure` and `easily` accessible log of customers and their billing information.  
 
#### This is a program that makes use of a very famous, easy and powerful, high-level programming language called [**Python**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and, an equally powerful and versatile database management software called [**Mysql**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL).
