#### This project is to create and test a Restaurant Management Program that achives the following criterias:
 1. Store information abut the food served at the restaurant, along with its price and info on if it is Veg or Non-Veg.
 2. A `logical` and and `easy` UI which does not hinder the speed of the service at the restaurant.
 3. A `foolproof` Error prevention mechanism that does not allow the program to crash mid operation.
 4. The incorporation of a Database Management system so as to keep logs and track the data `essential` to the restaurant.
 5. A `secure` and `easily` accessible log of customers and their billing information. 
 
#### This is program that makes use of a very famous, easy and powerful, high level programming language called [**Python**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and,
#### an equally powerful and versitile database management software called [**Mysql**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL).
